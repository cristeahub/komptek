\section{Symbol tables}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part a)}
A symbol table is a table to keep track of the identifiers of a source program.
There are two related meanings of symbol tables.

One is the symbol table in the object file. This table maps different items of the source program to names that the linker can understand.
If a function is called a placeholder value is put inside the symbol table for the object file and tells the linker to look up all the references of the object files before finally putting the location there.

The other symbol table is the shared library. This is produced by the linker and names the funcitons and data items. This allows the system to do run-time linking.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part b)}
Information regarding the different identifiers are stored in the symbol table.
This can vary form case to case, but some very common attributes is identifier name, address in memory, type of the identifier and scope.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part c)}
One implementation of a symbol table can be an ordered linear list.
The very good part of this is that the implementation is very easy and straight forward.
One major downside is that insertion is expensive and operations are slow.
This is implementation is very rarely used.

Another implementation is a binary search tree.
While being a bit harder to implement this gives a better time per operation.
O(log n) is the time for each operation.
This implementation is not so often used.

The most common implementation is a hash table.
This is very efficient and works very well for our case.
The drawback of this is that we need a bigger memory space than the number of variables.
Memory is usually not a problem in our time, so this is clearly the best.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% PROBLEM 2
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Symbol tables and blocks}
I have not included addresses in this task as I feel you can perfectly show your ability to understand symbol tables conceptually without that field.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part a)}
With a stack you start to search from the top of the stack and downwards. At position 1 the stack looks like this.
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    type  & identifier \\
    \hline
    bool   & b          \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    type  & identifier \\
    \hline
    int   & a          \\
    \hline
    float & b          \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

At position 2 the stack looks like this.
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    type  & identifier \\
    \hline
    bool   & a          \\
    \hline
    int & c          \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    type  & identifier \\
    \hline
    int   & b          \\
    \hline
    float & c          \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    type  & identifier \\
    \hline
    int   & a          \\
    \hline
    float & b          \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part b)}
With a single symbol table you have a scope number which corresponds to which scope one is in.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part c)}
With a stack one can easily see which variables are defined in this scope and which are not.
A good thing with this approach is that scope exit is very easy. You pop the topmost symbol table off the stack and you are done.
One major drawback is that looking for an element is O(stack size * avg table size), since you might need to look through all the symbol tables in all the stacks.
This might take a long time if you happen to have your variable on the last scope.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | p{6cm} |}
    \hline
    Operation  & Time & Description \\
    \hline
    Scope Entry & O(hash table size) & Need to initialize new hash table \\
    \hline
    Symbol Insertion & O(1) & Insert a symbol on the top of the stack \\
    \hline
    Symbol Lookup & O(stack size * avg table size) & In worst case you need to go through all the tables in the whole stach. \\
    \hline
    Scope Exit & O(1) & Pop the top of the stack \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

When you have one single symbol table with a scope number you will have one very big table.
This means you will have constant lookup time for every variable you have available.
With a hash table everything has O(1) lookup time, except exiting a scope.
Exiting the scope is done in O(hash table size) time, since you will need to look through all elements in the table, which is a drawback.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | p{6cm} |}
    \hline
    Operation  & Time & Description \\
    \hline
    Scope Entry & O(1) & Only single scope variables need to be incremented \\
    \hline
    Symbol Insertion & O(1) & Insert a node in a symbol's scope list \\
    \hline
    Symbol Lookup & O(1) & Constant time lookup in a hash table \\
    \hline
    Scope Exit & O(hash table size) & Will have to go through all the symbols to see if we need to pop some \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

% PROBLEM 3
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Type Checking}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part a)}
Synthesis is one of two forms of type checking.
This type builds up the type of an expression based on its subexpressions.
This means that the types of an expression make up the main expressions type.
This also requires names to be declared before use.

Interfence declares the type of a part of a language based on the way it's used.
For instance if we have a function that takes the average of a list named avg(x).
Based on that information we know that $x$ must be a list.
This does not require the names to be declared before use.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Part b)}
I am assuming a float is half a double and an int is as big as a float but with a different representation on the computer.
The complex prefix means two numbers, one real and one imaginary. Other than being two numbers the rules are the same.
With that in mind we get the following widening coversions.

The highest level has a complex double which uses the most size.
The next has a dounle and a complex float which uses the same size.
The next has a complex int, which uses a different representation in memory than the floating points.
After this there is a float which has a different representation than an integer.
And on the bottom there is an integer, which is the smallest.
